## HTTP Deprecation Headers

All API responses from deprecated services now include:

```http
X-API-Deprecated: true
X-API-Deprecation-Date: 2026-01-06
X-API-Deprecation-Info: This service is deprecated. Use [replacement] instead.
X-API-Sunset: 2026-06-01
Link: <http://[replacement]:port>; rel="successor-version"
Deprecation: true
```

These headers comply with:
- [RFC 8594 - Sunset HTTP Header](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8594)
- [Deprecation HTTP Header (draft)](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-dalal-deprecation-header-01.html)

---

## Docker Profile Usage

### Default Behavior (Recommended)

```bash
# Start platform WITHOUT deprecated services
docker-compose up

# Deprecated services will NOT start:
# - crop-health (Port 8100)
# - ndvi-engine (Port 8107)
```

### Backward Compatibility Mode

```bash
# Start platform WITH deprecated services
docker-compose --profile deprecated up

# This includes all services for backward compatibility
```

### Legacy Testing

```bash
# Start ONLY deprecated services for testing
docker-compose --profile legacy up crop-health ndvi-engine
```

---

## Migration Path

### For API Consumers

#### crop-health Migration

**Old Endpoints** → **New Endpoints**

```
OLD: GET  http://crop-health:8100/api/v1/fields/{field_id}/diagnosis
NEW: GET  http://crop-intelligence-service:8095/recommendations/{field_id}

OLD: POST http://crop-health:8100/api/v1/fields/{field_id}/zones/{zone_id}/observations
NEW: POST http://crop-intelligence-service:8095/zones/{zone_id}/observations

OLD: GET  http://crop-health:8100/api/v1/fields/{field_id}/vrt
NEW: POST http://crop-intelligence-service:8095/vrt/export
```

#### ndvi-engine Migration

**Old Endpoints** → **New Endpoints**

```
OLD: POST http://ndvi-engine:8107/ndvi/compute
NEW: GET  http://vegetation-analysis-service:8090/ndvi/{field_id}

OLD: POST http://ndvi-engine:8107/ndvi/zones
NEW: GET  http://vegetation-analysis-service:8090/analysis/{field_id}/stats

OLD: POST http://ndvi-engine:8107/ndvi/anomaly
NEW: GET  http://vegetation-analysis-service:8090/analysis/{field_id}/anomaly

OLD: POST http://ndvi-engine:8107/ndvi/indices
NEW: GET  http://vegetation-analysis-service:8090/indices/{field_id}
```

### For Kong API Gateway

Kong routes are already configured to forward deprecated service paths to replacement services:

```yaml
# /api/v1/crop-health → crop-intelligence-service:8095
# /api/v1/ndvi → ndvi-processor:8118 (also deprecated, should be vegetation-analysis-service:8090)
```

**⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED**: Update Kong route for `/api/v1/ndvi` to point directly to `vegetation-analysis-service:8090`

---

## Testing Verification

### Test Deprecation Headers

```bash
# Test crop-health
curl -I http://localhost:8100/healthz

# Expected output includes:
# X-API-Deprecated: true
# X-API-Deprecation-Date: 2026-01-06
# X-API-Sunset: 2026-06-01
```

```bash
# Test ndvi-engine
curl -I http://localhost:8107/healthz

# Expected output includes:
# X-API-Deprecated: true
# X-API-Deprecation-Date: 2026-01-06
# X-API-Sunset: 2026-06-01
```

### Test Startup Warnings

```bash
# Start deprecated services and check logs
docker-compose --profile deprecated up crop-health ndvi-engine

# Verify deprecation warnings appear in logs:
# ================================================================================
# ⚠️  DEPRECATION WARNING
# ================================================================================
# This service (crop-health) is DEPRECATED and will be removed in a future release.
# Please migrate to 'crop-intelligence-service' instead.
# ...
```

### Test API Documentation

```bash
# Visit Swagger docs
open http://localhost:8100/docs  # crop-health
open http://localhost:8107/docs  # ndvi-engine

# Title should show "(DEPRECATED)"
# Description should include deprecation notice
```

## Impact Analysis

### Services Affected

| Service | Impact | Action Required |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **Frontend (apps/web)** | Low | Kong routes already pointing to replacements |
| **Mobile (apps/mobile)** | Low | Using Kong API Gateway |
| **AI Advisor** | Medium | Update service URLs in config |
| **Field Intelligence** | Medium | Update NDVI service URL |
| **Integration Tests** | Medium | Update test URLs |

### Frontend References

Frontend code references `crop-health` but uses Kong API Gateway which already routes to `crop-intelligence-service`. No immediate changes required for frontend.

Files with references (using Kong routes):
- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/crop-health/CropHealthClient.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/features/crop-health/api.ts`
- `apps/web/src/features/crop-health/hooks/useCropHealth.ts`
- `apps/web/src/lib/services/service-switcher.ts`
