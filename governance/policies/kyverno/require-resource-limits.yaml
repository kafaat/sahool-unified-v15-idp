      As application workloads share cluster resources, it is important to limit resources
      requested and consumed by each Pod. This policy validates that all containers have
      resource requests and limits defined.
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: true
  rules:
    - name: enforce-resources
      match:
        any:
          - resources:
              kinds:
                - Pod
      validate:
        message: "يجب تحديد requests و limits - CPU and memory resource requests and limits are required."

          spec:
            containers:
              - resources:
                  requests:
                    cpu: "?*"
                    memory: "?*"
