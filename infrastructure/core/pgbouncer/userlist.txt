;; PGBouncer User List
;; Format: "username" "password_hash"
;;
;; IMPORTANT: This file is NOT used when auth_query is configured with auth_user.
;; PgBouncer will authenticate users by querying PostgreSQL via auth_query using
;; the auth_user (sahool) credentials specified in docker-compose environment variables.
;;
;; The auth_user (sahool) connects to PostgreSQL and runs the auth_query to retrieve
;; password hashes for any user trying to connect through PgBouncer.
;;
;; This approach:
;; 1. Eliminates the need to maintain this userlist.txt file
;; 2. Ensures passwords are always synchronized with PostgreSQL
;; 3. Supports SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication (PostgreSQL 16 default)
;;
;; For this to work:
;; - The auth_user (sahool) must have pg_monitor role (granted in 02-pgbouncer-user.sql)
;; - The auth_query uses pgbouncer.get_auth() security definer function
;; - The auth_user password is provided via POSTGRES_PASSWORD environment variable
;;
;; No entries needed below - kept for reference only
