# SAHOOL Shared Crypto Environment Variables
# ===========================================

# Primary Encryption Key (Required)
# Generate with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
# This should be 64 hex characters (32 bytes for AES-256)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# Deterministic Encryption Key (Required for searchable fields)
# Generate with same command as above, but use a DIFFERENT key
# This should be 64 hex characters (32 bytes for AES-256)
DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPTION_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# HMAC Secret Key (Required for data integrity)
# Can be any strong random string
HMAC_SECRET=your-hmac-secret-key-change-me

# Previous Encryption Key (Optional - for key rotation)
# When rotating keys, put the old key here temporarily
# PREVIOUS_ENCRYPTION_KEY=old-key-goes-here

# Environment
NODE_ENV=development

# Logging
CRYPTO_DEBUG=false
